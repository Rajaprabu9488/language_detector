# 🌍 Language Detection Using Deep Learning (PyTorch)

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a Language Detection System that automatically identifies the language of a given text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning with PyTorch.

The model is trained on multilingual text data and is capable of accurately classifying sentences into multiple languages. The project covers the complete machine learning workflow, including text preprocessing, feature vectorization, neural network training, evaluation, and prediction.

This project demonstrates practical skills in NLP, deep learning model design, multi-class classification, and PyTorch-based implementation, making it suitable for academic learning and portfolio presentation.
