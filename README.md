🌍 Language Detection using Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This project implements a Language Detection system that automatically identifies the language of a given text input using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Neural Network built with PyTorch.

The model is trained on multilingual text data and can accurately classify sentences into multiple languages.

🚀 Features

Detects language from short and long text inputs

Supports multiple languages

Built using PyTorch Neural Networks

Uses text preprocessing and vectorization

Trained and evaluated with train–test split

Model saving and loading supported
